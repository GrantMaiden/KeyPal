KeyPal is A project I worked with during my undergrad alongside my teammates, Dane Le, Justin Warner, and Spencer Anderson.

I was the only EE working on the project, so my main duties were to develop the schematic and PCB for the group. I also developed the MCU application, and took care of component selection as well as analyzed and timing constraints on the system.

KeyPal is a fun solution to helping teach a new typist the ins and outs of proper keyboard hand placement.
It has capacitive sensors in the homerow of the keyboard, to make sure that proper hand placement is intact during typing, as well as multicolor LEDs under every key on the keyboard. These light up to aid the typist in learning the keypositions while using the peripheral typing trainer application, which is written in python.
