Zebras - Africa's striped horses

There are three species of zebra, all found in Africa. These close relatives of the domestic horse can be recognized easily by their black and white striped body. 

The Plains or Burchell's zebra is found in open or wooded grasslands from northern South Africa westwards to Etosha Pan in Namibia and north as far as southern Somalia and southern Sudan. The Mountain zebra is found in semi-desert or savanna grasslands in Namibia and South Africa. Grevy's zebra is found in hot, dry semi-deserts in southern and eastern Ethiopia and northern Kenya.

Plains and Mountain zebras stand about 1.3 m at the shoulder and weigh 200 - 380 kg. Grevy's zebras are a little bigger - about 1.4-1.6 m high and up to 450 kg. All zebras have a neat, upright mane.

The three species of zebra can be identified by their stripes. The Plains zebra has stripes that reach under the belly. They broaden at the flanks and bend backwards towards the rump, forming a Y-shaped 'saddle'.

The stripes on Mountain zebras stop short of the white belly and form a distinctive pattern on the rump. Mountain zebras also have a small flap or dewlap on their throats.

Grevy's zebra has a white, unstriped belly, narrow stripes, and large rounded ears with white tips.

Zebras are generally grazers, feeding mainly on grass. They prefer tall grasses which most other species seem to avoid. Grevy's zebras also eat leaves. Zebras often mingle with other herbivores in mixed herds. This is partly for mutual defence: the larger the herd, the less likely any individual animal will be picked off by a lion. An alarm call by a zebra alerts the whole herd to danger. Also, because zebras remove long, coarse grasses, they help other grazing animals such as wildebeeste or buffalo to find shorter, more succulent grazing.
